# docker-gs-ping

A simple Go server/microservice example for [Docker's Go Language Guide](https://docs.docker.com/language/golang/).

Notable features:

* Includes a [multi-stage `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/olliefr/docker-gs-ping/blob/main/Dockerfile.multistage), which actually is a good example of how to build Go binaries _for production releases_.
* Has functional tests for application's business requirements with proper isolation between tests using [`ory/dockertest`](https://github.com/ory/dockertest).
* Has a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to run functional tests in independent containers.
* Has a CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to publish to Docker Hub.

Planned:

* Building Go modules and Docker images with `goreleaser`

## Want _moar_?!

There is a more advanced example in [olliefr/docker-gs-ping-roach](https://github.com/olliefr/docker-gs-ping-roach) using [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach).

## Contributing

This was written for an _introduction_ section of the Docker tutorial and as such it favours brevity and pedagogical clarity over robustness. 

Thus, feedback is welcome, but please no nits or pedantry. Ain't nobody got time for that ðŸ™ƒ
